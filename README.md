# To Do List

This project builds a web page to show "to-do list".

Many articles say that "to-do list" is very simple to FE beginner. I think that it's a nice try to learn js, css and html for me.

## Usage

Prepare Node.js environment at beginning, and run NPM install dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

Use Webpack to build everything. Execute Webpack cli scripts via NPM directives.

```bash
# run webpack-dev-server for local development
npm start
# run webpack to build
npm run build
```
